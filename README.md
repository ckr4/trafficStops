According to the Stanford Open Policing Project (SOPP), there are over 50,000 traffic stops conducted in the United States on an average day, yet there is no prescribed means to record and report those stops. The worst outcomes, involving the death of someone involved, are often parsed in depth and at times draw national interest, headlining news coverage and sparking calls for reform, protests, and broader movements to address underlying and related problems. However, contextualizing those individual events within the broader scope of traffic stops in the United States is difficult at best. 

The absence of a uniform reporting system across jurisdictions makes it challenging to compile accurate and comparable statistics on the frequency and nature of these interactions. Furthermore, disparities in data collection methods, reporting criteria, and the availability of information hinder efforts to draw meaningful conclusions about the patterns and trends associated with traffic stops. As a result, the true extent of disparities, potential biases, and the overall impact of traffic stops on various communities remains obscured, perpetuating a significant obstacle to informed policymaking and public discourse on this critical issue.

Without even the most rudimentary statistics for the population of traffic stops, there is no way to develop a shared understanding of where such outcomes fit within the system as a whole. Of the many missing pieces of information which could inform such an understanding, perhaps the most important is exactly who, demographically speaking, is the subject of these traffic stops. To help bridge this gap, this project utilized the traffic stop data accumulated by the SOPP and detailed annual demographic data for the United States from the U.S. Census Bureau to model the proportions of traffic stop subjects by age, race, and sex at the county level. 

Currently, only the final report and presentation for this project are available, but the code and data used will be uploaded by 1/1/2024.
